This was a homework project. I have no intention of finishing or continuing this idea, as I don't have homeworks anymore. YOLO.

# About
This application allows students to organize their assigned homeworks, in a manner very similar to a to-do list application.

# Planned features
- Registering new subjects and homeworks
- Homework deadline calendar
- Homework completion charts
- Reminder notifications (with email support)
- Various statistics

## Notifications
The student should be notified by its mobile app and/or by email whenever a deadline nears. The reminder period should be customizable (e.g. how many days before and at what time)

## Statistics and Charts
The statistics and charts will be targeted to a specific semester, year, and/or subject.

There will be statistics for:
